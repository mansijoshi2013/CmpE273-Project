		The Blood Donation and Retrieval Portal is designed keeping in mind those people who would like to volunteer to donate blood and for those who are looking for blood donors. 
		A person who wants to volunteer can register with this website using his email address. He can book an appointment at any of our clinics and donate blood at those clinics at any time. 
		He can see the blood drives that are taking place in his city and also view urgent requests for blood on his homepage.
		
		A patient who is in need for a blood donor needs to login to our website using his hospital ID as the credentials.
		He can then choose a blood group and location and view the donors (registered with us) who match his search criteria. 
		He can then send an email to the donors with his request.
